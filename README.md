# eurozon-frontend
A two-week group project to build a webshop using **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React** (frontend). The project was split into frontend and backend tasks, with responsibilities shifting in the second week.

I started with the frontend, so my learning focused primarily on React and front-end development.

## My Learnings

- **Light & Dark Mode**: Learned how to implement dynamic theming using Tailwind CSS and CSS variables.
- **Authentication**: Worked with auth cookies and user data, focusing on managing sessions based on cookies.
- **Product Grid**: Built a dynamic product grid where the component state depends on query parameters.
- **Form Handling**: Integrated `react-form-fields` with `zod` for form validation and handling.
- **Nested Categories Component**: Built a component for handling and displaying nested categories
- **UI Components**: Worked with `shadcn` for some components
